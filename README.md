The Pizza Shop React.js application with blockchain integration is a modern and secure solution for managing pizza orders, payments, and delivery using blockchain technology. The application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it leverages the decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain to enhance trust, security, and accountability in the pizza ordering process.

The main features of the application include:

User Interface: The application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface where customers can browse the menu, select their desired pizza options, customize toppings, and place their orders. The interface is built using React.js, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.

Order Management: The application allows users to create and manage their pizza orders. Customers can add pizzas to their cart, specify customizations, view order details, and track the status of their orders in real-time.

Blockchain Integration: The application incorporates blockchain technology to enhance security and transparency. Each pizza order is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, creating an immutable and auditable record of all orders. This ensures that order details cannot be tampered with and provides a transparent history of the entire ordering process.
